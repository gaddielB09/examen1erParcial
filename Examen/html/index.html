            <h2 class="story">Our Story</h2>
            
            <p>The General Muir, established in January 2013 at Emory Point, is a modern American restaurant inspired by classic New York Jewish Deli, <br> returning it to its hand-crafted roots. Traditional favorites are honored — pastrami is cured and smoked in house, bagels are hand rolled <br> and kettle boiled — and joined by dishes going beyond tradition, focusing on fresh ingredients and simple preparations. A second <br> location in Sandy Springs opened in 2021. </p>
            
            <p>The restaurant is named for the refugee transport ship that brought co-owner Jennifer Johnson's mother and grandparents, Holocaust <br> survivors, to New York in 1949.  <a href="">Read more about the origin of our name</a> and see the video by Atlanta Magazine below.</p>
            
            <p>The General Muir serves breakfast, lunch, and weekend brunch at both locations, plus dinner at the Emory location, and offers an <br> espresso bar serving locally-roasted Dancing Goats coffee as well as a full bar of wine, beer, spirits, and cocktails. Next door to the <br> original Emory location, you’ll find TGM Bread and TGM Soup Co. pairing fresh baked breads and soups for a quick lunch, as well as <br> loaves to take home. TGM Bread bakes all of the bread daily for both locations, the rest of the Rye Restaurants family, and many other <br> restaurants around town.</p>
            
            <h2 class="partners">The Partners </h2>
            
            <p>The General Muir is owned by Jennifer and Ben Johnson, Shelley Sweet, and Chef Todd Ginsberg, who also partner on <a href="">Fred's Meat &<br>Bread</a>and <a href="">Yalla</a> in Krog Street Market and Wood's Chapel BBQ in the historic Summerhill neighborhood of Atlanta — <a href="">the Rye Restaurants <br></a> family of restaurants.</p>
            
            <p>The Johnsons, husband and wife, opened West Egg on Atlanta’s Westside in 2004. Both Jennifer (our "office girl") and Ben (fondly referred <br> to as "errand boy," although Renaissance man is more like it!) are former attorneys who practiced law in Atlanta for nearly 7 and 11 years,<br> respectively, before embarking on a second career in hospitality. West Egg proudly celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2024.</p>
            
            <p>Shelley Sweet found her passion for the restaurant industry after graduating college and working in graphic design, beginning her <br> restaurant career at West Egg when it opened in 2004. She joined the Concentrics Restaurant Group in 2006, serving as a manager at<br>Two Urban Licks, Assistant General Manager at Murphy’s, and ultimately as General Manager of TAP from 2008 to 2010. She was the <br> opening General Manager at Hugh Acheson’s Empire State South. Coming full circle, Shelley rejoined West Egg in 2011 as General <br> Manager, becoming a partner in 2014. Shelley, Jennifer, and Ben continue to partner on West Egg, with Chef Andrew Smith. Shelley is a <br> member of Les Dames d’Escoffier International, Atlanta Chapter, and recently served on the Georgia Restaurant Association Board of <br> Directors.  </p>
            
            <p>In 2014 the Georgia Restaurant Association honored Jennifer, Ben, Shelley and Todd as Restaurateurs of the Year and, in 2018, StarChefs <br> recognized them as Rising Star Restaurateurs.</p>

            <p>The below images, taken from the deck of the Gen. Muir, were provided by Robert Boehm, whose father, Henry Boehm (Henryk Bohm) (center<br>of photo on left) arrived in this country aboard the Gen. Muir in March 1949, on the same voyage as Jennifer’s mother. We made this incredible<br>connection after the restaurant opened. Mr. Boehm, a Holocaust survivor, was a dentist, athlete, and Conservatory-trained operatic singer<br>from Lwow, Poland (now L’viv, Ukraine), just 40 miles from where Jennifer’s grandparents lived before the war. We appreciate the Boehm<br>family sharing these images; you can see them in person at our Sandy Springs location. </p>
